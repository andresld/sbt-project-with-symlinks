= SBT project with symlinks

After installing Scala metals extension on VSCode and importing the build, there are some navigation errors on log
file. However, it looks like code navigation can still be performed anyway. More specifically, tried code navigation is
from `corePiece/com/example/Laucher` at `sum()` function call to this function ubication at
`functionsPiece/com/example/functions#sum`.

Log file is also appended.

Steps to reproduce:

. open a VSCode editor
. install Scala (Metals) extension (if missing)
. open `entities/example-entity` project
. import the project build
. try to navigate to `sum()` function ubication at its call in `corePiece/com/example/Launcher`
